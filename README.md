CityQuest Tour is the app that embarks on an interactive experience to view the major sights of Vancouver in the form of a self-directed treasure hunt tour. As you follow the suggested route on your map, you will look for numbers to unlock an audio track that unveils the history of Yaletown and Gastown.

## Frond End
This app consists of MVC design pattern. The reason why I choose using MVC pattern is to create a simple app as much as I can because it was the first time to create an app. In addition, the idea of the app was not complicated so it was fit for MVC pattern.

## Database
To save the tour I chose to use Core Data which is the local database. Because this app needed to create that the user can use it even in the offline environment.
